This project is a simple weather app built using React that allows users to fetch real-time weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app features a search input where users can type a city name and either press "Enter" or click the "Search" button to retrieve the weather information. Upon submitting, the app fetches data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed, which is displayed if the search is successful. It also includes basic error handling, showing error messages like "city not found" if the input is invalid. The interface provides a clear button to reset the displayed data, and overall, it delivers a smooth user experience for checking weather conditions.
